# ðŸ“š Building a Smart Library Management System in Python

![Code Style: PEP 8](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-pep8-orange.svg)

This guide will walk you through building a command-line-based Smart Library Management System using Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. You'll learn how to design modular classes, implement data persistence, and create an interactive menu.

---

## âœ¨ Project Objectives: What You Will Learn

By following this tutorial, you will:

-   Apply core OOP concepts like Encapsulation, Inheritance (though minimal in this project, the structure supports it), Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
-   Design and implement modular and reusable Python classes (`Book`, `Member`, `Library`).
-   Implement file handling techniques for persistent data storage using text files.
-   Develop an interactive, menu-driven command-line interface (CLI) in Python.
-   Add advanced features like tracking borrowed books, generating transaction reports, and searching.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started: Setting Up Your Environment

Before we dive into coding, let's set up your project environment.

### Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have a recent version of Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
-   **A Text Editor/IDE**: Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text, or even a basic text editor will work.
-   **Terminal/Command Prompt**: For running Python scripts.

### 1. Create Your Project Directory

First, create a new folder for your project. You can name it `smart_library_system` or anything you prefer.

```bash
mkdir smart_library_system
cd smart_library_system
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

A virtual environment isolates your project's dependencies from your global Python installation. This is good practice.

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating the environment is active.

### 3. Create Essential Files

We'll need a few files to start:

-   `main.py`: This will contain all our Python code.
-   `books.txt`: To store book data.
-   `members.txt`: To store member data.
-   `transactions.log`: To log borrowing and returning activities.

Create these empty files in your project directory:

```bash
touch main.py books.txt members.txt transactions.log
# On Windows you might use 'fsutil file createnew books.txt 0' or 'type nul > books.txt'
```

---

## ðŸ“– Building the System: Step-by-Step

We'll implement the system by building our classes and then integrating them with file handling and a user interface.

### Step 1: Designing the `Book` Class

The `Book` class will represent each book in our library. It needs to store information about the book.

**`main.py` (Part 1)**

```python
# main.py

class Book:
    """
    Represents a book in the library.
    """
    def __init__(self, book_id, title, author, available_copies):
        self.book_id = book_id
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.available_copies = int(available_copies)

    def display_info(self):
        """Displays the book's information."""
        print(f"Book ID: {self.book_id} | Title: {self.title} | Author: {self.author} | Available: {self.available_copies}")

    def update_copies(self, number):
        """Updates the number of available copies (increase/decrease)."""
        self.available_copies += number
```

**Explanation:**
-   `__init__`: The constructor takes `book_id`, `title`, `author`, and `available_copies` as arguments. `available_copies` is cast to an integer to ensure numerical operations work correctly.
-   `display_info`: A simple method to print the book's details.
-   `update_copies`: Allows us to easily change the number of available copies when a book is borrowed (decrease by 1) or returned (increase by 1).

### Step 2: Designing the `Member` Class

The `Member` class will represent each library member, tracking their details and borrowed books.

**`main.py` (Part 2)**

```python
# main.py (continued from Part 1)

class Member:
    """
    Represents a library member.
    """
    def __init__(self, member_id, name, borrowed_books=None):
        self.member_id = member_id
        self.name = name
        # Initialize borrowed_books as an empty list if not provided
        self.borrowed_books = borrowed_books if borrowed_books is not None else []

    def borrow_book(self, book_title): # Changed to book_title for consistency with Library class
        """Adds a book title to the member's borrowed list."""
        if book_title not in self.borrowed_books:
            self.borrowed_books.append(book_title)

    def return_book(self, book_title): # Changed to book_title
        """Removes a book title from the member's borrowed list."""
        if book_title in self.borrowed_books:
            self.borrowed_books.remove(book_title)

    def display_member_info(self):
        """Displays the member's information and borrowed books."""
        print(f"Member ID: {self.member_id} | Name: {self.name}")
        if self.borrowed_books:
            print("  Borrowed Books:")
            for book_title in self.borrowed_books:
                print(f"  - {book_title}")
        else:
            print("  No books currently borrowed.")
```

**Explanation:**
-   `__init__`: Initializes a member with `member_id`, `name`, and an optional list of `borrowed_books`. This allows loading members who already have books.
-   `borrow_book` / `return_book`: These methods manage the `borrowed_books` list. They take a `book_title` (which is often more practical than a full `Book` object here for storage in text files).
-   `display_member_info`: Prints member details, including their currently borrowed books.

### Step 3: Designing the `Library` Class (Core Logic & File Handling)

The `Library` class is the heart of our system. It will manage collections of `Book` and `Member` objects, handle transactions, and manage data persistence.

**`main.py` (Part 3 - Initial Structure)**

```python
# main.py (continued from Part 2)

import os
import datetime

class Library:
    """
    Represents the library, managing books, members, and all transactions.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.books = []    # Stores Book objects
        self.members = []  # Stores Member objects
        self.borrow_count = {} # Tracks how many times each book has been borrowed
        self._load_data()  # Private helper method to load all data at startup

    def _load_data(self):
        """Loads all initial data (books, members) from files."""
        self._load_books()
        self._load_members()

                        # Initialize borrow_count for existing books if needed
                        self.borrow_count[title] = self.borrow_count.get(title, 0) # Ensure existing books are in borrow_count
                    except ValueError:

                        self.members.append(Member(member_id, name, borrowed_books))
                    except IndexError:
                        print(f"Warning: Skipping malformed member entry: {line.strip()}")
